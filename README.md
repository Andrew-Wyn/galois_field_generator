# galois_field_generator

A program that create, from a field with a cardinality some p and from a polinomy irreducible over such field p,  a Galois_Field with cardinality p^n(degree of that polinomy)

# features

* make a finite field with cardinality p^n.
* show additive and moltiplicative matrix of the field.
* given a polinomy calculate his irreducibility.
* given a polinomy calculate his additive degree in GF(Zp^n).
* given a polinomy calculate his moltiplicative degree in GF(Zp^n).
* given a polinomy calculate his splitting field like a normal extension of the Zp finite field.

# usage

* gcc finitefield -lm
