# galois_field_generator
A program that create, from a field with a cardinality some p and from a polinomy irreducible over such field p,  a Galois_Field with cardinality p^n(degree of that polinomy)

added calculator for splitting field given a polinomy over Zp (finite field of cardinality p) 

TODO:
	- optimize function that return division quotient between two polinomies

# usage


* ggcc finitefield -lm
* ./a.(out/exe)
